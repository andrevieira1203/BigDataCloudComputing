# BigDataCloudComputing
The goal of this project is to understand how services available in cloud computing platforms can
be used for creating applications that are scalable, fast, and highly available. It consists in the design and implementation of the backend for a hospital system like
hospital electronic health record databases as in the MIMIC-III database, and companion testing
scripts.
